# Iterative-Cluster-Analysis-Using-Multi-Omics-Modalities

This repository contains the source code and results of the iterative clustering of multiomics data and interpretation with the Biomedical Data Translator project. This project began at the 2022 Bio-IT FAIR Data Hackathon.

## Summary

* Wrangle the NICHD Kids First and INCLUDE data
* Perform unsupervised clustering of gene expression, somatic exome mutations calls with Human Phenotype Ontology terms
* Develop a predictive model to determine the features associated with each cluster
* Annotate results by querying the NCATS Biomedical Data Translator
